# Neural_Networks_cs
Neural networks in c# without the use of third party libraries.
  - Version 1 - Simple neural network with adjustable layer size and node number
              - Need some more testing for bugs
              - Includes cross validation
              - Currently an online learner
              
Upcoming improvements:
  - Parallize the neural network for multitheading
  - Convergence determination
  - Batchwise learning
